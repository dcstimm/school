This application creates a set of classes to implement a simple hierarchy of 
Shapes.  We created a standard Shape class and extended it to make simple shapes
like triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, lines, and even a polygon.

We can use these shapes to draw various graphics on the canvas, for example, 
we were able to use these to draw a mickey mouse using three circles, two for 
the ears and one for the round face.   

We could even use our shapes to draw a house, using the various shapes to 
construct the house.  For example, a square was used to make a window and a
triangle was used to draw the roof.  

****Extra Credit****

For the extra credit we created a new Polygon Shape class and a test driver. 

My test driver draws various polygons and let me explain to you what the test 
driver is doing.

First, I set the points I want for a Large star that I am going to draw in the
center of the canvas.  Next I put these points into an array and use them
to create the star.  

Next I copy the star and shift it over 5 pixels to the left and 5 pixels down
but I only do this if they copy was perfectly equal.  This creates a 3D look.

Second, I create four polygons and place them in each corner, I also copy,
check to see if they are equal and move them to the correct position. Then I 
give them all unique colors.

Third, I create a simple trapezoid and place it on the bottom center and set the
color to gray.  

I also display the Star's first and last points along with it's hashcode.  


I really enjoyed making this, and I hope you enjoy the graphics I created.
